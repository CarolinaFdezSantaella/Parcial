      "content": "Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game."

On a player's turn he may move his king two squares over to one side and then move the rook from that side's corner to right next to the king on the opposite side. However, the following conditions must be met: it must be that king's very first move, it must be that rook's very first move, there cannot be any pieces between the king and the rook, and the king may not be in check or pass through check."

This special move must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved past, otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available."
